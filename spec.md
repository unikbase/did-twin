## `twin` DID Method Specification

### 1. Introduction

The `twin` DID method provides a standardized way to identify digital twins using Decentralized Identifiers while preserving information about both their model type (using a modified DTMI) and a specific instance identifier.

### 2. DID Method Name

The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: `twin`.

### 3. DID Format

The general format of the `twin` DID is:
```
did:twin:hyphenReplacedDTMI:instanceUUID
```

Where:
- `hyphenReplacedDTMI` is the DTMI of the digital twin with all colons (`:`) and semicolons (`;`) replaced by hyphens (`-`).
- `instanceUUID` is a UUID representing the specific instance of the digital twin.

Example:
For a thermostat model with DTMI `dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1` and instance UUID `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`, the DID would be:
```
did:twin:dtmi-com-example-Thermostat-1:f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479
```

### 4. CRUD Operations

#### 4.1 Create (Register)

To create a `twin` DID, the user or system must:

1. Determine the DTMI for the digital twin.
2. Generate a UUID for the specific instance.
3. Format the DID as per the provided structure.

#### 4.2 Read (Resolve)

Resolving a `twin` DID would return a DID document associated with the DID. The resolver should recognize the `twin` method and parse the `hyphenReplacedDTMI` to understand the digital twin's model type and the specific instance.

#### 4.3 Update

Updates to the DID document associated with a `twin` DID can be made by authorized parties, typically the entity controlling the digital twin. The exact mechanism would depend on the underlying infrastructure chosen to host these DIDs.

#### 4.4 Delete (Revoke)

The deletion or revocation of a `twin` DID would involve marking the DID as inactive or removing its association. The exact process would depend on the underlying infrastructure.

### 5. Security & Privacy Considerations

Systems implementing the `twin` DID method should ensure:

- Secure generation and storage of UUIDs.
- Controlled access to CRUD operations, ensuring only authorized entities can make changes.
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms, if the DIDs are used in contexts where the digital twin's data is sensitive.

### 6. Conclusion

The `twin` DID method provides a structured way to uniquely identify digital twins in decentralized systems, capturing both their model type and specific instance. It bridges the gap between decentralized identity systems and the world of IoT and digital twins.
